📚 APTOS-Tokenized Peer-to-Peer Study Help

APTOS-Tokenized Peer-to-Peer Study Help is a next-generation decentralized learning platform built on the Aptos blockchain.
It empowers students to connect, collaborate, and grow together, while ensuring that every contribution in the academic community is fairly rewarded through blockchain-based tokenization.

Unlike traditional tutoring platforms that are centralized and profit-driven, this system is community-owned, transparent, and built to reward knowledge-sharing.
